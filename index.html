                <p>The 365-acre (1.48 km2) campus is known for its flora and fauna, notably deer and rare trees. The
                    college is distinguished by a lake on campus. The campus curator maintains these natural resources
                    and ensures that no damage is done through the unauthorized cutting of plants or grass. The first
                    curator of the campus was Prof. Edward Barnes Several faculty members from the Department of
                    Botany and Zoology have since served as curators of the campus. They are Dr. K.R. Venkattasubban,
                    Mr. Giles Lal, Dr. D.E.P. Jeyasingh, Dr. P. Dayanandan, C.Livingstone, Dr. G.Ebenezer, and Dr. Manu
                    Thomas. Dr.Selva Singh Richard from Botany Department is the current Curator of MCC.
                    It is the second-largest scrub jungle in Asia, actively used by departments like Botany and Zoology
                    for their practical work.</p>

                <p>MCC's largest auditorium, named after its founder Rev. John Anderson, was built in anticipation of
                    the third World Missionary Conference which was held here in 1938. In the words of Bishop Stephen
                    Neill, this event was "the most international gathering held up to that point in the entire history
                    of the Christian Church." The hall also hosted evangelist Billy Graham's visit to the campus in
                    1956. He delivered his address in this auditorium. The hall is used for a variety of events and has
                    hosted several notable people — the nation's highest leaders, politicians, theologians, preachers,
                    educators, businesspeople, civil servants, etc. — and continues to be the predominant indoor public
                    space on campus.</p>
